-- LATER --
[ ] Allow manually specifying function parameters
[ ] One-liner methods
[ ] Avoid recomputing the full path when using operation-assigment operators (e.g `a.b.c.d += 4` should not compute `a.b.c` twice)
[ ] Replace references to constants with their actual value when possible
[ ] Make `self` available in field default values
[ ] Add type parameter inference
[ ] Improve variable type inference according to their first use
[ ] Change the `?` suffix operator to return `none` if the expression it is applied to is `none`
[ ] Optimize `&&` and `||` when applied to boolean operands
[ ] Think of a way to loosen the restrictions on basic operators (e.g `3f * 2` sould work) (operator overloading?)
[ ] Encode errors in enum instead of hard-writting them
[ ] Reduce size of generated wat by merging functions that have exactly the same body
[ ] Unify function & value types (probably by introducing function overloading + `()` operator?)
[ ] Allow `@alloc` to return exactly 1 `i32`
[ ] Allow chaining function calls (e.g `a()()()`)
[ ] Improve `Link::borrow()`
[ ] Add `assert` macro or equivalent to do tests (and ensure everything is fine in prod)
[ ] Add stack trace somehow
[ ] Re-use temporary variables when possible
[ ] Detect unreachable path and adapt the return type of a block
[ ] Add a way to specify a `_init` method for objects, that will be run after an object is constructed
[ ] `if let` expression
[ ] Merge the way fields and methods are processed
[ ] Possibility to specify fields in interface
[ ] Solve the `none` issue when accessing fields/methods (should every field/method accessed be checked?)
[ ] Implement proper iterators
[ ] Improve interface system (basically copy the one from rust)
[ ] Generalize tuples
[ ] Change how interface are implemented to explicitely specify which interface is specified
[ ] Make VS code extension ignore errors from files with a `// ignore-errors` comment
[ ] Avoid re-validating document if no file has changed
[ ] Merge `TypeBlueprint` and `InterfaceBlueprint`
